# Development

This repository uses the Foundry smart contract toolkit. You can download the Foundry installer by running `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`, and then install the latest version by running `foundryup` on a new terminal window (additional instructions are available on the [Foundry repo](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation)).
